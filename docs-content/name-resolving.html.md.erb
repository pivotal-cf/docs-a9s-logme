This topic describes the name resolving capabilities of a9s LogMe for PCF.

## <a id='name-resolving'></a> Name Resolving

There are two ways to obtain the IP address for service instance DNS name:

+ Use the Consul cluster which comes with the installation of a9s LogMe
+ Use the a9s BOSH DNS which can be installed on each Diego cell

### <a id='name-resolving-with-consul'></a> Name Resolving with Consul

a9s LogMe for PCF comes with its own highly available Consul cluster for
service discovery and service failover procedures.

Consul is an HA service discovery and configuration tool, which includes features
such as failure detection, an HA key/value store, and an HA DNS service that you
can control through an HTTP-based REST interface.

To make use of this feature, talk to your company's nameserver administrator
to set up a delegation of a9s LogMe hostnames.
The hostnames of these queries end with `a9s-logme-consul` by default
and must be delegated to the IP addresses of the Consul server within the a9s
LogMe tile. To figure out the IP addresses check the status tab of the
tile and look for `a9s Consul Cluster`.

### <a id='name-resolving-with-a9s-bosh-dns-handler'></a> Name Resolving With a9s BOSH DNS Handler

The BOSH Director comes with a native DNS support.
The DNS release provides a way to delegate certain domains via the handlers property
to different DNS servers.

a9s LogMe comes with the a9s BOSH DNS Handler.
The release creates a file which is used by BOSH DNS to add an additional BOSH
handler to the BOSH DNS configuration. See
[Additional Handlers](https://bosh.io/docs/dns/#additional-handlers).
The file is stored here: `/var/vcap/jobs/a9s-logme-bosh-dns-handler/dns/handlers.json`.
It follows the [handlers_files_glob](https://bosh.io/jobs/bosh-dns?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-dns-release#p=handlers).
The DNS Handler is only applied to the Diego cells where it is needed. It is
applied through a runtime configuration. The tile must be deployed before the
feature can be enabled, because it refers to an already installed a9s LogMe
for PCF tile.

1. Import and stage a9s LogMe for PCF as described above.
   Confirm that `Enable BOSH DNS Handler` is disabled.
1. Apply the changes only for the a9s LogMe for PCF tile.
1. After the tile is deployed and the smoke-tests have run successfully,
   set `Enable BOSH DNS Handler` in the **Management Cluster** page to enabled.
1. Redeploy only the (PAS)[https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-application-service]
tile and the a9s LogMe for PCF tile again.

If the installation was successful, an app deployed on PCF can resolve all a9s
LogMe instances with its DNS name.
