After updating the a9s LogMe for Pivotal Platform tile, run the Deployment Updater errand to update all provisioned service instances to the new service and stemcell versions.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> anynines recommends running the smoke tests before running this errand.
See <a href="./installing.html#errands" target="_blank">Post-Deploy Errands</a>.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To run the errand, you must know how to use the BOSH Director. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/customizing/trouble-advanced.html" target="_blank">Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</a>.</p>
