<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The a9s LogMe for Pivotal
Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation
and test purposes only. Do not use this product in a PCF production
environment.</p>

This documentation describes the a9s LogMe for PCF tile. a9s LogMe for PCF
enables on-demand provisioning of a pre-configured
[ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana) Stack.
The ELK stack makes service and application logs queriable, visualizable, and
scalable. Developers can create instances of a LogMe server or cluster using
Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI), and bind
these instances to an application to monitor it, or use them to monitor
services. Depending on your service plan, a service instance may be associated
with a single, dedicated VM, or a set of VMs consisting of multiple VMs
containing a LogMe cluster.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

as LogMe for PCF enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated LogMe
servers. App developers can create instances of a LogMe server using Apps
Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI) and bind
these instances to an app to monitor it or use them to monitor services. The
service runs on a single, dedicated VM, the size of which depends on your
service plan.

a9s LogMe for PCF automatically provisions service instances and creates a
dedicated VM for each instance. This isolates service instances, preventing the
"noisy neighbor" problem that can occur when multiple service instances run on
a shared VM.

Because the service provisions VMs as needed, only existing service instances
use infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. With on-demand provisioning, the number of service
instances grows or shrinks based on demand.

### <a></a> Current Features

a9s LogMe for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| **On-demand service instance provisioning** | a9s LogMe for PCF deploys LogMe instances automatically. Developers can provision a LogMe service, on a single VM or cluster of VMs, using the single command `cf create-service`. |
| **Service instance isolation** | Each LogMe server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure noisy-neighbor protection and align with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s LogMe for PCF uses Cloud Foundry [application security groups (ASGs)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) to prevent network connections from unauthorized apps.
| **Smoke tests** | A post-deployment, smoke-test errand runs basic tests against your installation, ensuring that it is configured properly. |
| **Deployment updater** | An updater errand updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s LogMe for PCF service instances to their latest version. |
| **Syslog Endpoints for Instances** | In the tile a default endpoint for syslog and Graphite can be configured for each service instances which is created by the end user. |
| **Consul Domain configurable** | The consul domain can now be configured. |
| **BOSH DNS Handler** | a9s BOSH DNS handler added to make a9s service instances accessible from Diego cells. |
| **a9s-pg Backup** | Added backup option for a9s-pg. |
| **Instance Sharing** | a9s MySQL no supports instance sharing between orgs an spaces, see [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html). |
