This topic describes the backup of the management cluster database **a9s-pg**
from an operators perspective.

## <a id='a9s-pg-backup-limitations'></a> Limitations

Because a9s-pg is the main database for the a9s Backup
Manager and all services around a9s Elasticsearch for PCF, the consistency of
the backup information of a9s-pg is not guaranteed:

- Restores of a9s-pg cannot be stored in the database because at the time
  the restore is running the database where the restore information is stored is
  gone and was restored to a previous point in time.
- All backups that have been triggered after the backup which is restored are not
  longer known in the database.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Be aware that restoring the a9s-pg to a
   previous point in time, means you might lose information about deployed instances.
   This results in ghost instances that cannot be handled by the a9s Service Broker
   and a9s Deployer.</p>

## <a id='trigger-backups-and-restore'></a> Prerequisites

Before you can trigger a backup, you need the IP address and the credentials of
the a9s Backup Manager.

1. Navigate to the **Status** tab of the tile and record the IP address of one of
  the a9s Ancillary Service instances.

    <%= image_tag("status_tab.png", width: 300) %>

1. On the **Credentials** tab, find the credentials of the service under
  **Backup Manager Password**. The username is `admin`.

## <a id='a9s-pg-backup-trigger-a-backup'></a> Trigger a Backup

1. Curl the `backup_agent/backup` API endpoint of the a9s Backup Manager.

    ```bash
  $ curl http://backup:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/backup -d "instance_guid=a9s-pg" {"message":"job to backup is queued"}
  ```

2. Get the state of the backup by curling the `instances/a9s-pg` endpoint of the backup manager.

    ```bash
  $ curl admin:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/instances/a9s-pg
    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                   Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  100  9906    0  9906    0     0   3691      0 --:--:--  0:00:02 --:--:--  3690
  {
    "restores": [],
    "backups": [
      {
        "backup_agent_task": {
          "msg": null,
          "updated_at": "2018-11-22T04:01:28.853Z",
          "created_at": "2018-11-22T04:00:15.718Z",
          "status": "done",
          "task_id": 148,
          "id": 156
        },
        "is_downloadable": false,
        "size": 44985152,
        "backup_id": "a9s-pg-1542859215559",
        "instance_id": 38,
        "id": 148
      }
    ],
    "instance_id": "a9s-pg",
    "id": 38
  }
  ```

The status flag `"backups.backup_agent_task.status"` can have the following values:

* `"done"` when the backup is finished
* `"running"` when the backup is running
* `"queued"` while the backup is only queued
* `"failed"` once the backup failed
* `"deleted"` when the backup has been deleted

## <a id='a9s-pg-backup-restore-a-backup'></a> Restore a Backup

Use the `backup_agent/restores` endpoint to restore a backup.
You need the `instance_id` and the `backup_id` (given as id) from the backup you
want to restore. To get this information you need to curl the `instances/a9s-pg`
endpoint before, see [Trigger a backup](backup.html#a9s-pg-backup-trigger-a-backup).

```json
{
  "restores": [],
  "backups": [
    {
...
      "instance_id": 38,
      "id": 148
...
    }
  ]
}
```

Then trigger the restore:
```
$curl admin:53cr3t&commat;172.28.7.64:3000/backup_agent/restores -d "backup_id=148" -d "instance_id=38"
{"restore_id":5}
```

During the restore of the a9s-pg the a9s Backup Manager is not available and cannot be used
to see the state of the restore process, see also [Limitations](backup.html#a9s-pg-backup-limitations).
You can watch the backup-agent logs of the a9s-pg master node to see the state.
On the VM itself you can use the following command:

```
$ tail -f /var/vcap/sys/log/backup-agent/production.log
```
